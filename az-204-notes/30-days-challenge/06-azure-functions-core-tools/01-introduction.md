## Introduction

The Azure Functions Core Tools are command-line utilities that enable developers to develop and run functions locally, and subsequently publish them to Azure.

Suppose you're a developer for a car dealership franchise. The salespeople are seeking modernization in their workflow. Your manager decides to build a set of applications backed by Azure Functions. The initial service your manager wants to build involves loan interest calculations. You're tasked with creating functions that can be called over the web to execute loan interest calculations. You begin by learning how to utilize the Azure Functions Core Tools to construct and publish a function project.

## Module Overview

In this module, you will utilize the Azure Functions Core Tools, accessible from the Azure CLI, to create a new local function project and a function app. You will modify the starter code generated by the Core Tools to execute a simple interest calculation and test the function locally. Once it's prepared, you will use the Azure CLI to generate a function app in Azure, publish your function, and then invoke it over the web.

By the conclusion of this module, you will be adept at utilizing the Core Tools to produce and execute functions locally, as well as publishing them to Azure.
