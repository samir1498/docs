# Introduction

Durable Functions is an extension of Azure Functions designed for orchestrating long-lasting, stateful operations in Azure. It enables developers to build complex workflows and stateful orchestrations in a serverless environment while abstracting away concerns related to activity monitoring, synchronization, and runtime management.

Consider a scenario where a company has a manual approval process for project design proposals. To automate this process while still involving human interactions, Durable Functions can be utilized. This solution needs to handle activities of varying duration, ensure cost-effectiveness, and accommodate custom business logic.

Throughout this module, you'll gain an understanding of Durable Functions, design a long-running approval process workflow, and implement it using Durable Functions.
