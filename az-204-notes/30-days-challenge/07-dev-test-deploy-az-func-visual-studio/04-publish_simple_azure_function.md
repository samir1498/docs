# Overview: Publishing a Simple Azure Function

In this module, you'll learn about different methods for publishing Azure Functions to the cloud. The objective is to deploy the Azure Functions you've created in the luxury watch online website scenario.

## Deployment Options

1. **Deploy from Visual Studio:**
   - Utilize Azure Functions tools for Visual Studio to deploy directly from Visual Studio.
   - The Publish wizard guides you through connecting to your Azure account and selecting an existing function app or creating a new one.
   - Functions in your project are rebuilt and deployed to the function app in Azure.
   - Suitable for developers for testing and deploying code in an environment similar to production.

2. **Continuous Deployment:**
   - Azure Functions supports continuous integration with various deployment sources, including Bitbucket, GitHub, Azure DevOps, etc.
   - Integrates with source control systems, triggering deployments to Azure whenever function code updates occur.
   - Ideal for projects with frequent contributions and the need for maintaining source control.

3. **Zip Deployment:**
   - Functions can be deployed from a zip file using push deployment via Azure CLI or REST interface.
   - The zip file contains executable code for the functions, which is copied to the wwwroot folder in the Azure Function App.
   - Zip deployment is performed using the `functionapp deployment source config-zip` command in Azure CLI.

## Next Steps

Proceed to the next unit to practice publishing a simple Azure Function using Visual Studio. You'll explore the Publish wizard in detail and learn how to deploy your function app to Azure.

This module provides essential insights into deploying Azure Functions, enabling you to choose the most suitable method based on your project requirements.
