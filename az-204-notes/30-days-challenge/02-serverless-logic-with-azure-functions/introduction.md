# Create Serverless Logic with Azure Functions

## Introduction

Imagine you work for an escalator company that uses IoT sensors to track the temperature of its gears. You write code to process this data and add a flag when the temperature is abnormal.

Your company gets temperature data from several sensors, and you want to develop a reusable service to process it. The data comes from different sources, and you want to process it all in one place, without having to worry about resource allocation.

If you're building a service that needs to process data from multiple sources, you can use serverless computing to build a scalable and cost-effective solution.

## Learning Objectives

In this module, you will:

- Decide if `serverless computing` is right for your business needs.
- Create an `Azure function` app in the Azure portal.
- Execute a `function` using `triggers`.
- Monitor and test your Azure function from the Azure portal.
