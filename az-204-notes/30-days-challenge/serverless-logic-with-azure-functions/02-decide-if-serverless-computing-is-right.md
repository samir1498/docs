# Decide if Serverless Computing is Right for Your Business Needs

## What is Serverless Compute?

Serverless compute is like running code in the cloud without worrying about provisioning servers. The cloud provider automatically scales your code to match demand. Azure offers two ways to do this: Logic Apps and Azure Functions which are the focus of this module.

## What is Azure Functions?

Azure Functions is a serverless application platform. It enables developers to host business logic that can be executed without provisioning infrastructure. Azure Functions provides intrinsic scalability and you're charged only for the resources used. You can write your function code in the language of your choice, including C#, Java, JavaScript, Python, and PowerShell. Support for package managers like NuGet and npm is also included, so you can use popular libraries in your business logic.

## Benefits of a Serverless Compute Solution

Serverless compute is a great option for hosting business logic code in the cloud. With serverless offerings such as Azure Functions, you can write your business logic in the language of your choice. You get automatic scaling, you have no servers to manage, and you're charged based on what is used not on reserved time. Here are some other characteristics of a serverless solution for you to consider:

- Avoids over-allocation of infrastructure
- Stateless logic
- Event driven
- Functions can be used in traditional compute environments

## Drawbacks of a Serverless Compute Solution

Serverless compute, as provided by Azure Functions in the Consumption plan, isn't always the appropriate solution to hosting your business logic. Here are a few characteristics of functions that may affect your decision to host your services in serverless compute:

- Execution time
- Execution frequency
