# Anatomy of an Azure Function

## Visual Studio Code Integration

- Visual Studio Code (VS Code) serves as the primary environment for writing Azure functions.
- Strong integrations exist between Azure functions and Visual Studio Code, facilitating remote function management.

## Key Files in an Azure Function

1. **functions.json**:
   - Configures a single function, defining bindings.
   - Bindings are extensively discussed in the Azure Functions section of the course.
2. **Function Code**:
   - Typically a JavaScript file, containing the actual code of the function.
3. **func ignore**:
   - Similar to a `.gitignore` file, used to exclude specific files from being packaged during deployment.
   - These excluded files may still be utilized during local development.
4. **host.json**:
   - Contains global configuration settings for all functions at the function app level.

## Local Project and Remote Storage

- Local projects store functions locally before deployment to Azure.
- Files in the local project mirror those found in remote storage on Azure.
- Common files include `host.json`, `function.json`, `index`, `local settings.json`, and `package.json`.

## Significance and Course Emphasis

- Understanding the anatomy of Azure function files is critical for creating and managing functions effectively.
- This knowledge is essential for success in the AZ204 course, where creating functions is a core component.

## Conclusion

- Proficiency in Visual Studio Code and familiarity with the structure of Azure function files are fundamental for efficient development and deployment in Azure.
