# Storage Considerations for Azure Functions

- Azure Functions rely on a connected storage account for operational functionality. If this storage account is deleted, the functions will cease to operate effectively.

- **Storage Types Used by Azure Functions:**
  - **Blob Storage:** Maintains binding state and function keys.
  - **Azure Files File Share:** Used for storing and executing function app code. While it is default in consumption and premium plans, function apps can be created without Azure Files under specific conditions.
  - **Queue Storage:** Employed by task hubs in durable functions.
  - **Table Storage:** Also utilized by task hubs and durable functions.

- Understanding the diverse storage types is crucial as it can vary based on the specific use case of the Azure Functions being implemented. 

- Visualizing the relationship between function apps and their associated storage account provides insight into the critical role of storage in the functionality of Azure Functions.

- Proper management and preservation of the storage account are essential to ensure the seamless operation of Azure Functions.
