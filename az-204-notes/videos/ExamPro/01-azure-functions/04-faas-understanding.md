# Understanding Function as a Service (FaaS)

Function as a Service (FaaS), also known as "serverless," is a cloud computing model that allows developers to focus solely on writing code functions, abstracting away the complexity of managing servers.

## Key Points

1. **Focused Development**: FaaS enables developers to concentrate on writing code functions without concerning themselves with server management or infrastructure setup.

2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: FaaS operates on an event-driven architecture, triggering functions based on event data or emitting event data as required. This facilitates the creation of serverless applications or microservices.

3. **On-Demand Execution**: Functions within FaaS only execute when needed, contributing to efficiency and cost-effectiveness. This means resources are allocated dynamically based on demand.

4. **True Serverlessness**: FaaS is considered truly "serverless" only when it's fully managed and can scale to zero. Scaling to zero implies that resources are automatically adjusted based on demand, allowing for optimal resource utilization and cost savings.

5. **Underlying Infrastructure**: The underlying infrastructure for FaaS typically involves physical servers, a host operating system, and possibly a hypervisor or container runtime environment. Functions are deployed within containers tailored for specific languages such as Ruby, Java, Python, or .NET.

Understanding FaaS is essential for modern application development, as it offers scalability, cost efficiency, and agility for developers to build and deploy applications seamlessly.
